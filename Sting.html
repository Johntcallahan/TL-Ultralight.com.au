<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:16px;">The Sting S4 is a composite aircraft with engine located in the front. The primary structure contains 85% of carbon fiber for maximum strength and weight saving. The wing skin and fuselage is a sandwich of carbon and foam core, glued together with epoxy glue. The coating is then evacuated and cured in an oven. Highly stressed parts are made in an autoclave. High safety carbon frame with ROPS ensures crew safety, even in the case of the aicraft being overturned. Varnishing is done using white dual-component paint. The final design touches are made by vinyl foil covering.</span></div>
